# CORD_19_Research

# Project Name: Data Mining with Python - CORD-19 Research Challenge

## Description

This project leverages the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19).

The CORD-19 dataset is a free resource of over 400,000 scholarly articles, both with and without full text, about COVID-19 and the coronavirus group of viruses. It was released to encourage the global research community to use recent advances in AI and data analysis to generate new insights in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

## How to Use
main.py is the main file to run. It will run the entire project.

## Installation

Python 3.7.6 is required to run this project. The following packages are required to run this project:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* nltk
* sklearn

## Project Structure

metadata.csv - This file contains metadata for all of the articles in the CORD-19 dataset. The metadata includes the title, authors, abstract, publication date, and other information about the articles.

I cannot upload this file to Github because it is too large. You can download it from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/download

Notebook.ipynb - This file contains test  code for the project. It is a Jupyter Notebook file.

## Results

Once experiments have been completed and results have been generated, they will be stored in the `results` directory. The `results` directory will contain a subdirectory for each experiment. Each experiment subdirectory will contain a `results.csv` file that contains the results of the experiment. The `results.csv` file will contain the following columns:


| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Experiment | The name of the experiment |
| Model | The name of the model |
| Accuracy | The accuracy of the model |
| Precision | The precision of the model |
| Recall | The recall of the model |
| F1 | The F1 score of the model |
